# capturePhoto-rs

Trying to capture a photo using the Media Capture API. Code on main.rs does not work and throws the error

Os {code: -2147483634, kind: Uncategorized, message: "A method was called at an unexpected time." }

 so I'm trying to use
the MediaCapture API instead, which is on the main2.rs file
